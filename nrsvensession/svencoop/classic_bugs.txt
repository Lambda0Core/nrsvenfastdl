Known Bugs in Classic 1.5
_________________________

These are the bugs that I know of in Classic.  Be careful!!
As CScarlet once said, RTFM!!!!!

* DO NOT noclip in the map!  If you hit an entity that plays music, you
may play the music out of order!  The result will be having multiple
music tracks playing at once!

* DO NOT run ripent on my map!  That's right 60-megabyte-file, don't
hack this map!  The entity count is kinda high, almost at 800 (the
sven-coop limit is 900, and that's excluding the temporary 500 entity
limit.)  If you do, you may accidentally go over the entity limit,
causing the map to explode.

* DO NOT run the map in software mode! Steam/Half-life WILL CRASH!  Run
the map in OpenGL or Direct3D.  OpenGL is the best one you can pick,
but Direct3D also works, but the framerates are a little lower (my
head is still vibrating from seeing what the map looks like in Direct
3D.)

* PLEASE DO kill all the monsters you come across!  This map has a large
amount of monsters in it -- if you run past monsters like how you would
in normal DOOM, then don't blame me if your server explodes!  There
really isn't enough monsters to make a server crash -- if you run past
monsters though, something could happen.  I designed the map so monsters
would spawn as you progress through the map, so if anything happens,
it's not my fault.

* Towards the end of the map, when "Hiding the Secrests" plays, 
something once happened where I fired a rocket, passed through it, and 
the game crashed.  Probably one of thoserare-out-no-where game crash 
bugs, but I'm still going to mention it.

* The e_polygon count in the spawn area is a little high.  This is a
heads up!

* Recomended players is 4-8.

* Please stay away from the hidden developer room in the map.  If you
fart around inside there, you could accidentally teleport yourself to
somewhere in the map, causing multiple music tracks to run at the same
time!

* The amount of lightdata in the map is set for 9 megs.  This MAY
cause performance issues on slow computers!

Updates for Classic 1.5
_______________________

* The lag issue in the outdoor area of the map should be changed.  There
should be a lot less lag there.

* Run the map on a fast server!  This map doesn't do to well on slow servers!
As long as your server isn't dead slow, the map should be okay.  I lowered
the lag issue BECAUSE slow servers couldn't handle that one part.

* Lighting quality is mildly better.  Lowered the original 10 meg lightdata
amount to 9 megs.
