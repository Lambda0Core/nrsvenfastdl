ARCTIC INCIDENT
===============
By XF-Alien


The action takes place in a scientific complex, which is located somewhere in the Arctic.

In the caves, scientists have found a new form of life, which is resistant to frost and incredibly aggressive to intrusion.
The staff at the complex do not have sufficient means to counter it.
As a consequence they are forced to ask for help from the military, but the military, apparently, have their own plans for the incident.

You as the only survivors must fight your way through the blistering cold, with all odds against you, and finally escape.
