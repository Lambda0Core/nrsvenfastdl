And few other people who I possibly can't remember.

How this map works:

- There are no built-in rules in this map because technical limitations,
So knowledge of how to play chess is required.

- However, there is detailed description and info of how every
chess piece acts. Spend some time reading the legend.

- Press one of the buttons at the corner of the board to join the game (Max. 2 players).

- Press use to chess piece you want to move, it'll start to glow.
Then go to desired spot and press use again to make the chess piece teleport into you.

- 2 players can reset the game by starting a vote(Requires 100% of people answering yes).

- Leaving the chess area drops you off the game(Walking in the dark red area).
