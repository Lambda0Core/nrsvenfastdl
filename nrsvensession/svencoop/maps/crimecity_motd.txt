Map by MizzyMiz

///Premise///////////////////////////////////

You arrived into this city on a train and your primary objective is to leave.

Do some jobs for the local criminals (Yakuza, Russian mob, Mobius INC, the police) and get enough money to leave this place.
This is an open world map with multiple paths to complete it.

(Each faction has 4 quests and will mostly lock out eachother, so you should focus on one faction per playthrough)

///Money///////////////////////////////////

You can get Digibux for completing missions, as well as just finding it laying around. You can buy weapons and other things with it.
You should probably buy a weapon first, because most first missions need a weapon to be completed.

You can also unlock the bus system, which acts as a fast travel method. Be careful with it, because you can accidentally telefrag your friends!

(I am bad at mapping so if you are carrying too much money for something you will need to drop them from the inventory by pressing I)

///Objective///////////////////////////////////

The questlines will tell you what to do, usually take the money and go back to the train station. 
This map is survival mode by default so make sure to buy the medkit and take care of eachother, some fights can be hard.

If you hurt civilians the police will become hostile to you, and will be hostile until the end of the map.
Hurting a faction member will only anger that faction, the police will not care. They also do not care about homeless people.

If you mess up and anger any faction you didn't want to anger, you can restart the map from the train station or by typing "restart" into the console.
