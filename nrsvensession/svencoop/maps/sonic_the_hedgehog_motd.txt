Welcome to Sonic The Hedgehog


Story: You have to go through all 6 zones to get to Dr.Eggman.
Along the way there are 6 Hidden Chaos Emeralds that you have
to find to unlock the minigame where the last chaos emerald is.
Once you get the last emerald you unlock Super Sonic mode.



I do plan on making a sonic_the_hedgehog2.
