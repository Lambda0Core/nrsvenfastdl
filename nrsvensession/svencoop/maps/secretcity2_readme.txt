Sequel to my puzzle map secretcity, secretcity2 doesnt really continue where the first map finished, because the first map was never finished. Thats why I made this, I was unable to continue the first one due to a number of problems, and i wanted to start anew.
The premise is the same as the first map, just complete the puzzles and find secrets. There are a lot more of both, compared to the last map.

I would like to thank the following people, without whom the map would never have been made:

- Slidje
Ideas, support and always ran a server for us to test the map. He has also been my friend for a long time.

- Burnout64
More ideas, compiling the map, and more things that wouldnt fit into this text file.

- Beastate
I was off the internet for a long time, and when I came back I thought I lost the origional secretcity forever. Beastate found the last version I made of the old map, and gave it to me. I released it, and the posotive feedback from it was the reason I began the sequel.



I hit the entity limit so this is all the map. No real ending again, but i think that there are enough secrets and puzzles to keep players occupied.
There may be an updated version one day. Check http://turrican.decksix.com/maps for info on secretcity2 and more of my maps.
