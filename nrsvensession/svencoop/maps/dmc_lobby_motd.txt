Deathmatch Classic: Sven Co-op remake
By Zorik
=========
Welcome to Deathmatch Classic. Gameplay is similar to Quake. Player who scores the most frags under 30 minutes wins. Maximum number of frags is 50.
To start the vote in lobby, press on a map picture or button.
All maps should be fine with sizable amount of player, but for convenience I split them in 3 sections by recommended player count:
-Left(Green): 2-5 players;
-Middle(Yellow): 6-12 players;
-Right(Red): >12 players.
Script version can be checked by typing ".dmc_version" in chat.
Players can enter observer mode by typing ".dmc_spectate" but lose 1 score point.
Default looped Half-life soundtrack was replaced with UNT99 soundtrack.
