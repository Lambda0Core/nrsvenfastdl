   --------============== GAUSSLAB BETA2 ==============--------

			Map created by Keen

	 Ideas and Testing by Floodkiller, Turrican and Kain

		  This map is a beta and not done.

	 I missplaced the first part of this map so this
       is Second half, which is much harder then the first.

	==================================================
	     		HOW TO GAUSS JUMP?

	1. Hold down secondary fire on the gaussgun half or
	all the way charged.

	2. Point the gun in the opposite way you wanna travel
	usually you want to go up, so you point down.

	3. Let go of secondary fire, and depending on the
	the jump, you may want to jump as your flying into
	the are or HOLD DOWN CROUCH depending where your going.
