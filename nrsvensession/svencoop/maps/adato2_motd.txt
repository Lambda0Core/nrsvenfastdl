Another Day At The Office (ADATO) part 2:

The Story Continues:
"Holy crap!" you say to yourself, "I've heard of disturbances in the facility before, but nothing even close to the scale of this!" You continue making your way through the facility. Taking a brief respite to take stock of your equipment,
you realize that poor maintenance and overuse have rendered your guns utterly useless. You decide to discard them and keep your eyes peeled for replacements. While the facility seems to stretch on further in several directions, something
tells you that your journey is drawing to a close. "I've made it this far, so I might as well buckle up and put an end to this incursion once and for all!" you confidently declare. You have no idea what trials and secrets lurk around every corner.

Tips:
-Stay together!!! Splitting up can easily result in loss of life.
-The key to utilizing the rooftop fan properly is to hold forward and then jump when near the middle of the fan.
-For the alien puzzle, make sure each block is pushed all the way into the back of each module before pressing the button.
-Take the time to explore the map before riding the elevator up. You never know what you could find.
-Stay frosty and work together to improve your odds of survival.
