This map was created for messing around in. As the name suggests, it is full of secrets. Secret buttons, hidden buttons. I finished this map in late 2003, but I could not release it due to a number of stupid reasons. Eventually I lost the RMF in an equally stupid incident, and could'nt work on it anymore, making this version the last version I ever made. The same moronic incident which lost me the RMF also lost me the BSP, but I recently managed to get it from a friend, who had been circulating the map around svencoop in my absence.
Now I can properly release the map. Although it isnt finished, its as close as it will ever get now. But a secretcity2 is coming.

The map has no 'objectives', and no ending. Think of it like a 'lounge map', or an indoors OMG.
