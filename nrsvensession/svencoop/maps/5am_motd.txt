Original release date: December 11, 2001
Sven co-opified (ripent edit) by Wayne (2023)

Description:

The city has been seized by a paramilitary group and no one can tell what
is going on, we have a few members in the vicinity, and the aliens keep
creeping up.

In the street there's a hotel where this group seen like they are trying to
find something, what could it be?
------------------------------------------------
Wayne's notes:

This little ripent was inspired by the levels made by Fortune, since in
his maps there already was various references to Hondo's levels. And also
the hotel kinda looks like USP Ninjas by NIPPER, so there's that.

There's a big puzzle area, once you reach a certain point in the puzzle
the map will enter in a state that, if players try to end the level through
normal means a vote will start asking whether the map should end or not for the
sake of the puzzles.

Particularly i did not like how this ripent turned out,
it should've been way better than this, but just beign
able to play 5AM in SC should be enough; unless someone
can think of something else :)

The original bsp name was ahl_5am.bsp,
the prefix was dropped to avoid any misunderstandings.

 Title                   : 5:00 am v.3
 Date                    : December 11, 2001 (minor changes made 1/28/2002)
 Filename                : ahl_5am.bsp

 Description             : It's just about to break on morning, the sky is no longer
                           black, but you're still wide awake and shooting people in
                           their faces. A typical day, I would guess.

                           A section of a city centered around one street. There's a
                           full hotel, an abandoned crackhouse, a large underground
                           street tunnel, and a partially-collapsed freeway (They
                           don't make them like they used to, apparantly).

                           This version adds a respectable secret. Not to mention the
                           retexturing, fixed doors, new Fish Scratch Fever clip,
                           new routes into, out of, and between the hotel rooms,
                           echoes, sky, and a new Puffy clip to those who reach it.
                           That's the J-pop Puffy. It still reminds me heavily of the
                           original and it looks a lot better, so I think it was a
                           good idea to revisit it. Secret notes are at the bottom.

 Other Levels By Me      : Some levels for Quake 1, Quake 2, Block War for AQ2, many
                           for AHL (so far 5am, Block War, Endless Rain, No Credit,
                           HDH, and whatever other versions there are of each)

 Additional Credits      : The degenerate people of THE SPECIAL PLACE. The other AHL
                           testers. Mloclam/Alice/Luke for the textures which I
                           used as bases for a few of my own.

* The Hidden Love *

It is the hardest one I've made so far.

You must be on a roundless mode to access it.

DO NOT try it in single player. Start a LAN game if you're going to try it alone or
you will be very sad when you die.

* * *

And now, the hints. These are all I will ever give. If you e-mail me asking for
hints or solutions, I will delete your mail and hate you forever. If you message me
in IRC, I will ban you forever (unless you are one of the few). Ask others all you
want. Post freely. Solve amongst yourselves.

To get in, try the hotel interior. However, the beginning is not IN the hotel.

To get to 7:00 is not terribly hard.

To get to the complete end requires several completely hidden and unintuitive complex
solution which in parts require two people. I have no suggestion as to how to discover
these.

* * *

If you find either of the ways back into the real world from the secret world, DONE
IN NORMAL SERVER CIRCUMSTANCES WITH NORMAL GRAVITY, then please e-mail me and tell me
the full solution and I'll.. I don't know. You'll have my respect or something. One
of the ways back is not death. And if you tell me the solution and skip anything
I'll know you cheated and hate you forever.
