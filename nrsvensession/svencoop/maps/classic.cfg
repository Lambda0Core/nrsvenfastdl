## Sven Co-op map CFG file - Classic Arcade First Person Shooter
## Map Author: G.Ballblue gballblue@msn.com

## Place starting weapon_ and ammo_ cmds here (players spawn with them)
## Ammo cmds MUST have a number after them!, as with the 9mm cmd below.
## Can also use 'item_longjump', and 'nosuit' (Nosuit not recommeded!)

## This is NOT the original CFG file.  This cfg file was copied from
## Osprey Attack -- this was so I could easily make a CFG file for
## this map.  If you're a mapper and you found this, then you can use
## some of the notes Sniper left so you can make your own CFG file.

## One more thing:  If you edit a CFG file, you MUST put ## in front
## of every line of comment you make!! Or else, you WILL make HL
## crash when the game loads!! GOT IT SMART GUY?
