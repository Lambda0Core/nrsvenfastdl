The Mustard Factory

Your goal:
- Produce mustard.
- Close rifts.

For instructions, consult your handbook (tertiary fire), which will be available after a difficulty setting has been chosen.

The buttons for choosing a difficulty setting are unlocked 15 seconds after game start.

A humble request for server owners: For this level, please disable XP Mod and other server mods that make the game easier or otherwise break gameplay. I promise you will enjoy making mustard without 400 hp!
