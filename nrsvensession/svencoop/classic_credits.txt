Thanks to all the players who enjoyed my map through version 1.0, and was
willing to put up with the lag issue mid way through map.

The machine gun model was created by somebody else, not ME! I did not
center the origin of the weapon because I thought the model looked so
good :D  Unfortunately, I cannot give credit to the person who made the
model because he did not include a credits file in the .zip!!!!

Great model man, whoever you are =D

Also, I wanna thank the guy who made the "hellfire alien_slave".  Great
models, the both of you!

Special thanks goes to FRAGGARD and FISHY from the Snarkpit!  They helped
me with a very important compile issue!  Thank you, you two!

Beta Changes
============

G.Ballblue:  I changed a lot of things over the development of Classic.
Some stuff was cut, some things were added, some things were
moddified.  Enjoy!

Original Concept
________________

  In the original design of Classic, the Containment Area did not
exist.  Also, The Imp's Song was not originally planned to go in the
map.  It was added because I wanted to extend the amount of music
played while in game -- there were numerous other songs added later
on, but The Imp's Song was the only addition that made it into the 
final version.
  In the Nuclear Plant area, (part where Imp's Song is played) there
were originally hanging acloves on the walls.  These were removed
in the much later versions of Classic, mainly because the w_poly was
being driven up the walls in that area!  Also, when the realistic
water was added, the framerate began to drop so much, that the acloves
really REALLY had to go.  There was also a visual bug where you could
see these acloves floating in the sky.
  Originally, the only thing that was going to be "reskinned" about
the weapons was the actual physical gun.  I was playing around with
reskinning the arms with the v_9mmhandgun model, and well, I turned 
them green, and I decided to make all the models like that!

  Numerous alpha screens can be seen where the guns were not fully
skinned.  My default handgun, and shotgun models, can be seen in only
a couple of them.

1st Revision
____________

  In the room where the players started, I originally had 2 
solider zombies placed there -- this was just to make sure the game 
did not get drab.  I (wisely) removed them.
  In the next room, where you encounter the hoarde of zombies, I
originally only had about 8 - 10 zombies in there.  They were lined
up perfectly in two nice neat rows.  I later changed Sven-Coop so it
would render the low polygon zombies instead, this allowed me to place
about three times the zombies in the room.  So, should I have been 
worried that some players are using the high polygon models?
From what I have read on the forums, most people seem to like the low
definition ones.  Anyways.

  In the first room of the Nuclear Plant, where you encounter the
Pinky for the first time, there was intended to be about 5-6 Pinkys in
that room!  However, due to the high polygon count
in all areas, I dropped the Pinky count down to one. 
I later bumped it up to 1 Trooper, and 2 Pinkys.

2nd Revision
____________

  With a lack of ideas to finish up the Nuclear Plant, I had the 
sudden urge to add the Containment area!  And I did.  As you know,
when you aproach the button that raises the elevator to the Nuclear
Plant, a hidden door opens and about 4 Troopers jump out at you.  As
you know, there is a door behind the secret door -- this was originally
intended to be an "alternate route" that you did not have to take,
but the players who did brave it would be rewarded with lots of goodies,
and so on.
  The door on the left, was originally a secret area with three
buttons in it.  If you pressed the wrong button, you got smashed,
and you heard a .wav file saying "You are an idiot! Ho ho ho!".
Oh, and the door behind you closed and locked, so you couldn't go back
inside and try again :P
  If you pressed the correct button, the door behind the players when
you start the map would open up, with a hexagonal room that "me stuff"
all around it, and the BFG 9000.

3rd Revision
____________

  The original Final Boss was to be a Cyber Demon -- Gargantua.
The original area style would be a combination of the ending outdoor
area in E1M8, and E2M8, playing the music track "Facing the Spider."
However, I decided to revise this, and construct the final boss area
so it more closely resembled the final boss level of all of DOOM.
The premise was, the players would first teleport into the long
hallway, and procede down it.  Once the battle began, the room in the
middle of arena would unlock, and the players would be able to teleport
into it, and various other areas around that portion of the map.

(You can see the 4 teleports the players would use in the "big hallway"
in the 3rd chapter of the game.  I locked the doors in the end, but
you can still see them.  The white teleport is still operational, but
you have to noclip to get to it.)

  The boss battle would flow somewhat like this:  the players would
fight all the mosters in the map, from weakest to hardest, in wavs of
four.  Like so:  4 Troopers, 4 Saregents, 4 Imps, 4 Pinkys, 4 Lost
Souls, 4 Baron of Hells, 4 Spider Demons, and the grand finale would
be a Cyber Demon, which would probably be a Baby Gargantua with the
hull size jumbo sized (so handgun bullets and buckshot, etc, could
damage it).  The Cyber Demon's flame damage would probably be
100 HP per second.  Deadly, just like the real thing.

Sadly, I chose to cut the boss battle, due to allocblock: full trouble.

Later Revisions
_______________

  Some of the map had to be cut down in size, due to a huge inflation
in leaf_threads.  I got an allocblock: full error numerous times
throughout the development of this map -- for some incredible reasons!
The original ending of the map featured the "bunny scene" where I 
would use third person cameras to make the scene unfold in front of the
players.  At the time, of me writing this, I am reluctant to put the
scene in or not, since I am afraid that even the slightest altercation
to the solid geometry structure of the map could cause another
allocblock: full error.

  In the last area in the game, before the final boss, I planned on
having a room that was designed like something in the level
"House of Pain" from the third chapter of DOOM.  The room is hard
to describe, so I won't.  If you look closely, you can see the sections
of that level that I implemented in the map (the red hallway that burns
you, and the room with 8 buttons, but only 4 doors.)  Instead of
having the player rounding a corner and blamo! Game over, I had 
planned to make a multi-floored room with monsters high above, down low,
far away, up close, and some interesting architecture.  I HATE LEAF
THREADS!  :(

==============
After Thoughts
==============

  I want to thank all (if anybody :( ) the Sven-Coop players who were
enthusiatic about my map through its development time -- 3/4 of a year!
I want to thank all the Sven-Coop players who played my map, enjoyed
it or not, thank you for playing it!  You made very happy just by
doing that!
Since the map is currently not done, (this is a random guess) if 
anyone puts this map on their server as a dedicated map, I would like
to thank them to.
If this map makes it into the BOMS, then I wanna fall over and drool
on the floor =D
If this map makes it as an official map, then I wanna thank every
freakin' person on the planet!!!!
I would like to say thank you to any of the SnarkPit members who were
enthusiastic about my map, and posted their comments about it.
I would like to thank the two members at the SnarkPit who "watched"
my map.

Lastly, I would like to thank all the fans of the original DOOM,
and any DOOM fans who enjoyed my map, and I would like to thank id
software for creating the most legendary video game of all time.





*sob* Goodbye!

***THE STORY OF DOOM***
_______________________

You're a marine, one of Earth's toughest, hardened in combat and trained
for action. Three years ago you assaulted a superior officer for 
ordering his soldiers to fire upon civilians. He and his body cast were 
shipped to Pearl Harbor, while you were transferred to Mars, home of the
Union Aerospace Corporation. The UAC is a multi-planetary conglomerate 
with radioactive waste facilities on Mars and its two moons, Phobos and
Deimos. With no action for fifty million miles, your day consisted of 
suckin' dust and watchin' restricted flicks in the rec room.

For the last four years the military, UAC's biggest supplier, has used 
the remote facilities on Phobos and Deimos to conduct various secret 
projects, including research on inter-dimensional space travel. So far 
they have been able to open gateways between Phobos and Deimos, 
throwing a few gadgets into one and watching them come out the other. 
Recently however, the Gateways have grown dangerously unstable. 
Military "volunteers" entering them have either disappeared or been 
stricken with a strange form of insanity-babbling vulgarities, 
bludgeoning anything that breathes, and finally suffering and 
untimely death of full body explosion. Matching heads with torsos to 
send home to the folks became a full-time job. Latest military 
reports state that the research is suffering a small set-back, 
but everything is under control.
A few hours ago, Mars received a garbled message from Phobos. 
"We require immediate military support. Something fraggin' evil is 
coming out of the Gateways! Computer systems have gone berserk!" The 
rest was incoherent. Soon Afterwards, Deimos simply vanished from the 
sky. Since then, attempts to establish contact with either moon have 
been unsuccessful. You and your buddies, the only combat troop for 
fifty million miles were sent up pronto to Phobos. You were ordered to 
secure the perimeter of the base while the rest of the team went inside. 
For several hours, your radio picked up the sounds of combat: 
guns firing, 
men yelling orders, 
screams, 
bones cracking, 
then finally, 
silence. 
Seems your buddies are dead.

It's Up To You. 

Things aren't looking too 
good.

You'll never navigate off the planet on your own. Plus, all the heavy 
weapons have been taken by the assault team leaving you with only a 
pistol. If only you could get your hands around a plasma rifle or even 
a shotgun you could take a few down on your way out. Whatever killed 
your buddies deserves a couple of pellets in the forehead. Securing 
your helmet, you exit the landing pod. Hopefully you can find more 
substantial fire power somewhere within the station. As you walk 
through the main entrance of the base, you hear animal like growls 
echoing throughout the distant corridors. They know your here. 

There's no turning back now. 

***EDITED FOR SVEN-COOP VERSION***

The few survivors of what just happened emerge from the front door
of Hangar2.  "It's hell in there!"  One of them shouts.  "Most of us
didn't make it through the first room!  And any of us who did, are like
some kind freagin' dead bodies'-- with guns!"

So, everyone's dead.

The group only appears to have their handguns with them, not to
mention their berserker packs.  It looks like they used all of their
beefy guns up -- seeing as though everyone walked in with shotguns and
rocket launchers, and are now emerging with the crappiest of weapons.
You know it's bad.  If you hadn't figured out that things were bad
by this point, then mayber it's time to get a new hero.  Anyhow,
marines don't just run out of ammo in a combat situation -- there's got
to be a lot of them in there.  A whole lot of them.  Whatever "them" is.

The marine in charge pulls out a map of the base -- he then informs 
everyone that the base doesn't look like it should.  Caves are appearing
under ground, rooms are flooding with toxic slime, normal walls
are creating light when they shouldn't, and computer labs are being 
turned into death traps.  The only part of the base that isn't affected,
is the small escape pod located God-knows-where on the western side of
the base.  Past the Hangar, past the caves, past the outter walls of
the base, past the house of hell.

Your team only hopes they can get back to Earth before hell invades.
But hey, you're the heros -- everything is going to be okay... right?

Hints
=====

Hint 1:  If you get stuck in the Containment Area, try looking for some
crates that appear to be upside-down.

Hint 2:  Conserve your machinegun ammo!  That thing will really
come in handy when you need to mow down a bunch of imps, or lesser
monsters!

Hint 3:  In the Outter Perimeter, just before you walk off one of those
high ledges and take 10 damage, try crouching, THEN slide off the ledge.
Release the crouch button before you hit the ground.

Hint 4:  In the Hell Keep, try luring the monsters through the smooshers
instead of actually fighting them with your weapons.  It may take a 
while to kill them, but it will pay off in the end, assuming you can
dodge their attacks.

Hint 5*:  (DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO SPOIL A SECRET!!!)
While you are in the House of Pain, you will notice that there are
8 buttons hanging on 2 pillars.  Strangely, there are only 5 doors.
Press all 8 of them, then backtrack to where you fought the spider 
demon.  Remember that stack of crates in the hallway?  Jump up high
enough so you can see the top of the highest crate.

Now, remember that room in the Containment Area that had a gun 
just out of jumping reach from you?

Yep.  You know what I'm talking about -- you know what to do.

*If you notice, in the room with 8 buttons, there are 3 imps standing
next to 3 buttons.  I originally designed the game so that you had to
press THOSE THREE BUTTONS FIRST, then you could press the other five.
And of course, if you did that, you would receive the wonderful prize
that you just spoiled (lamer!)  If you pressed any of the other 5
buttons first, then you would not be able claim your "prize."
However, due to a bug in scripting with the buttons and entities, the
original design did not work.  I decided to put a 4th, (9th) button
in that was harder to find and see.
