BLACKMESA TRAINING SIMULATION - RESONANCE CASCADE
V1.06

Known bugs:
Load times can be abit long - it's moving around 400 entities afterall
Inventory items that are important will respawn after 2 minutes where you found them
Npcs roam, they will get stuck as a consequence, I have tried to limit it as much as possible but its a big map
sometimes Engineers will spin like beyblades - apologises

Tips:
-if on solo mode, scientists can be used to open retina scanners if you aren't research
-if on solo mode, security guards can be used to open security rooms at level 1 status if you aren't a security guard
-the map operates on the basis of - Show, don't tell - if the room has a window or a camera, it might reveal an item
-you will probably die a good few times, it's expected. use maps around the facility to get your bearings
-everything, is random. Enemies, Ammo, Weapons, Items - even key items have the possibility to move.
-Important items will glow the first time, this will help everybody see the items
-map uses the inventory system to its extreme, please make sure you have it bound
-map uses vaulting, please make sure mp_disable_autoclimb is 0 
-Relaxed is harder than Storymode
-If you have two of the same item, do not immediately activate them one after the other, it will despawn.
-Most common question is where are the gears, make sure to fully explore the surroundings.
-play tortured if you really hate yourself
